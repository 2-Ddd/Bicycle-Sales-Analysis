A prominent agricultural firm requires a precise rain forecasting algorithm to enhance their decision-making process for essential farming tasks like planting and irrigation.

Utilizing ten years of historical rainfall data from various regions in Australia, it is crucial to predict weather conditions, particularly rainfall, for the following day.

## Objectives
- Identify the key factors and conditions on any given day that may influence rain the following day.
- Evaluate various machine learning algorithms to determine their effectiveness in predicting rainfall within a 24-hour period.
- Determine which geographical location experiences the most frequent occurrences of rainfall.
- Assess the practical implications of employing predictive models for enhancing operational efficiencies in the agricultural sector.
## Conclusion
- Analysis of heatmap and SHAP values reveals that Humidity at 3pm and Sunshine are pivotal factors influencing rain prediction for the subsequent day.
- Among the machine learning algorithms evaluated, the Random Forest classifier emerges as the top performer, achieving the highest AUC score compared to other classifiers.
- Portland stands out as the location with the highest incidence of rainfall, notably during the months of May through August.
- Simulation findings suggest that adopting predictive models could potentially yield a substantial 32% reduction in water supply costs for agricultural businesses.
